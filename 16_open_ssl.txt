Install the necessary libraries
#yum install mod_ssl

Create a directory to store the keys
mkdir /etc/httpd/pki
Create a self-signed certificate

#openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/httpd/pki/apache.key -out /etc/httpd/pki/apache.crt
You'll be asked to fill out a few fields. The most important line is "Common Name." Enter your official domain name here or, if you don't have one yet, enter your site's IP address.

Edit the config file

#vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
Scroll down until you find the VirtualHost _default_:443 section.

Uncomment the DocumentRoot and ServerName lines.

Change example.com in the ServerName line to either your domain name or server's IP address. Important: This needs to match the common name on the certificate.

ServerName example.com:443
Scroll down and ensure that SSL is configured with the following lines.

SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/pki/apache.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/pki/apache.key
Save and exit.

Restart Apache

/etc/init.d/httpd restart
That's it!
